**Blinkit Sales & Outlet Analysis**

**ðŸ§  Objective**:
To analyze sales, item categories, outlet types, and customer behavior using Power BI and uncover business growth opportunities for Blinkit.

**Tools Used**:
- Power BI
- Excel
- SQL
- Python

**ðŸ“‚ Dataset**:
- Sales and ratings data from various Blinkit outlets across India.
- Covers attributes like item types, outlet location/type/size, ratings, and year-wise performance.

**ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights**:

- **Tier 3 cities** have the highest total sales (â‚¹472K) â€” untapped growth markets
- **High-sized outlets** generate the most revenue
- **Supermarket Type 1** leads in sales (~â‚¹787K)
- **Fruits & Vegetables** and **Snacks** dominate category-wise sales
- **Breakfast items & Starchy foods** are underperforming

### ðŸ“Œ Recommendations:
  1. Blinkit should increase delivery hubs and micro-warehouses in Tier 3 cities. A dedicated local fulfillment model (hyperlocal tie-ups) can reduce delivery           times and boost retention.
  **Impact**: Captures fast-growing rural demand, reduces cost-per-delivery, aligns with Meeshoâ€™s Bharat-first strategy.

 2.Create combo offers or discounts that bundle slow-moving items (e.g., Bread + Dairy + Snacks). Promote these bundles through app banners and push notifications.
  **Impact**: Improves stock rotation, reduces dead inventory, increases average basket size.
    
 3. Replicate the Supermarket Type 1 model in more cities. Reallocate resources from lower-performing formats (e.g., Grocery Stores, Type 3) to scale Type 1 faster.
  **Impact**: Scales high-performing model, maximizes ROI on outlet expansion.
    
 4.Use high-sized outlets as multi-category fulfillment centers and enable 10â€“15 minute delivery zones around them using app-level priority logic.
  **Impact**: Increases order value + delivery speed; builds competitive advantage vs Zepto, Instamart.

 5.Implement a personalized recommendation engine based on purchase history + geolocation. Improve search ranking algorithm for poorly viewed SKUs.
  **Impact**: Improves discoverability, increases conversion rate per session.
 
 6.Run targeted win-back campaigns using customer cohorts who dropped off post-2019. Offer cashback or loyalty points.
  **Impact**: Reactivates dormant users, raises month-over-month revenue growth.
